Requirements
==================

   The Fhtagn! C++ Library depends heavily on boost. If boost is not part
of your development environment yet, obtain a copy from http://www.boost.org/

Installation
==================

   In addition to the generic installation instructions in the INSTALL file,
you may need to specifice the --with-boost parameter to the configure script.

   If your copy of boost is installed in a non-standard location, specify where
`configure' may find boost by providing the `--with-boost' option followed by
an installation root.  On my machine, I run:

    ./configure --with-boost=/opt/local

   `configure` then attempts to locate the boost header files in
`/opt/local/include/boost' and the libraries in `/opt/local/lib'.
